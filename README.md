# Research Network Visualizer

Visualize the impact of your academic research — see your publications, citations, and global reach on an interactive network graph, 3D globe, and scholar rankings.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub (click "Fork" button), then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Research_Network.git
cd Research_Network
```

### 2. Set Up `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your info:

```env
# Required
SCHOLAR_ID=YOUR_SCHOLAR_ID

# Optional — for publication classification (set the key for your provider)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
# GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza-xxx
model=gpt-4o-mini
```

Your Scholar ID is in your Google Scholar profile URL:
`scholar.google.com/citations?user=`**YOUR_ID**

> `.env` is gitignored — your keys never leave your machine. The LLM provider is auto-detected from which API key you set.

### 3. Install & Run the Scraper

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies & run (reads SCHOLAR_ID from .env)
uv run python scraper/scholar_scraper.py

# Or pass Scholar ID directly
uv run python scraper/scholar_scraper.py YOUR_SCHOLAR_ID
```

`uv run` auto-creates a virtualenv and installs dependencies on first run — no manual `pip install` needed.

This will:
1. Open Chrome and scrape your Google Scholar profile
2. Collect all publications and their citing papers
3. Fetch author profiles (full names, institutions, citations)
4. Infer countries from institutions (no LLM needed)
5. Save everything to `data/network.json`

**Options:**

```bash
# Headless mode (no browser window)
uv run python scraper/scholar_scraper.py --headless

# With LLM classification (themes + summaries, requires API key in .env)
uv run python scraper/scholar_scraper.py --classify
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo on GitHub → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. The included `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` auto-deploys on every push

### 5. Push & Deploy

```bash
git add data/network.json
git commit -m "Update research data"
git push
```

Your site goes live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Research_Network/`

Anyone who opens the link sees your results — no keys or setup needed.

## Updating Your Data

The scraper supports **incremental updates** — it compares with existing data and only fetches what's new:

```bash
# Just re-run the scraper
uv run python scraper/scholar_scraper.py

# Then push
git add data/network.json && git commit -m "Update research data" && git push
```

It will:
- Detect new publications automatically
- Fetch citations only for publications with new citing papers
- Reuse cached data for unchanged publications
- Fetch profiles only for new Scholar IDs

## Three Views

Toggle between views using the **Network / Globe / Scholar** buttons.

### Network View
Interactive force-directed graph of your research network.

- **Center node** = You
- **Level 1** = Your publications (sized by citation count, colored by research theme)
- **Level 2** = Papers that cite yours
- Click a publication to expand/collapse its citations
- Hover for details (title, year, citations, summary)
- Filter by year range, top K, keyword search

### Globe View
3D rotating globe showing where your citations come from.

- Countries **light up** — brighter = more citations
- **Hover** a country to see citation count and top institutions
- Scroll down for **ranked leaderboards** (top countries + top institutions)
- Toggle **First Author / All Authors** mode

### Scholar View
Ranking tables for collaborators and citing authors.

- **Collaborators** — co-authors ranked by papers together
- **Citing Authors** — who cites your work, with institution, country, total citations
- **Hover** any row to see which publications they collaborated on / cited
- **Click** a name to visit their Google Scholar profile (if available)
- Toggle **First Author / All Authors** mode

## Configuration (`.env`)

| Variable | Description | Required? |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| `SCHOLAR_ID` | Your Google Scholar user ID | Yes |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key | Only for `--classify` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic (Claude) API key | Only for `--classify` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key | Only for `--classify` |
| `model` | Model override (default: auto per provider) | No |

Set **one** API key — the provider is auto-detected. The `--classify` flag uses the LLM to:
- **Classify** publications into research themes (Healthcare, NLP, CV, etc.)
- **Summarize** each paper in one sentence

Everything else (scraping, geo inference, author profiles) works without an LLM.
